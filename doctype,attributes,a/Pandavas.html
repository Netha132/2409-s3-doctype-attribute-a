    <h1>Pandavas</h1>
    <p>The Pandavas is a group name referring to the five legendary brothers, Yudhishtira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, who are central figures of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. They are acknowledged as the sons of Pandu, the King of Kuru, but were fathered by different Devas due to Pandu's cursed inability to naturally conceive children. After the split, the other part of the kingdom was ruled by their cousins, the Kauravas. and go into exile for 13 years.</p>
    <p> After this time the Kauravas refused to return the kingdom. As a result, the Pandavas waged a civil war against their extended family, and this conflict was known as the Kurukshetra War. With the help of the god Krishna, the Pandavas eventually won th1]Yudhishthira war with the death of the Kauravas, albeit at great cost</p>
